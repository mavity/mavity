# Spectral magnitude discrepancy: evidence and analysis

This document collects hard evidence for the observed magnitude mismatch in the spectral (PM/FFT) pipeline, clarifies what parts are working, lists likely causes, and provides context and links to the source diagnostics and code.

## Scope

- Focus: Under 32³ tests, the real-space force grid and sampled particle forces are much smaller than the analytic expectation for simple setups (e.g., two-body at r=2, G=3e-4).
- Out of scope (contextual): 64³ runs show NaNs that originate before spectral stages (integration/bounds issue). We reference them only for context.

## What we observe (evidence)

### Two-body, 32³ grid (magnitude is too small)

Source: [`15-oak-0153-46.md`](./15-oak-0153-46.md) → “small-scale: two particles attract each other” failure.

- Setup summary (from the dump):
  - Grid: 32³, world bounds ≈ [-3,3]³ (worldSize [6,6,6])
  - Two particles at x = -1 and +1, masses 1 each
  - Timestep dt = 0.01, G = 3e-4, soft = 0.15
- Spectral force spectrum peak magnitude:
  - forceSpectrumX.real range includes max ≈ +0.6420 and min ≈ -0.5535
- Inverse FFT (force grid X component):
  - forceGridX.fx range: [-3.57e-5, +2.32e-5]
- Sampled forces at particle positions (trilinear):
  - totalForceMag ≈ 1.94e-6
  - fx mean ≈ 1.00e-6; fy ≈ 3.43e-7; fz ≈ -1.63e-6

All of the above are captured verbatim in:
- [`15-oak-0153-46.md`](./15-oak-0153-46.md) (search for: “small-scale: two particles attract each other”).

Analytic baseline for comparison:
- For two unit masses separated by r = 2, Newtonian |F| = G / r² = 3e-4 / 4 = 7.5e-5.
- Observed sampled force magnitude is O(1e-6), roughly 50–150× smaller than 7.5e-5, depending on component and sample.

### Mass deposition sanity in 32³

- Multiple 32³ diagnostics report the correct total mass after deposit:
  - Two-body: massGrid totalMass = 2.000
  - Other 32³ tests in the same session show totals (e.g., 20.00, 30.00, 50.00) matching the number of unit-mass particles
-- Reference: same [`15-oak-0153-46.md`](./15-oak-0153-46.md), sections showing “massGrid: totalMass=…”.

### 64³ runs produce NaNs before spectral math (context only)

- In several 64³ cases, positions are already NaN at KDeposit; massGrid totalMass=NaN; complex imag channel is often 0 before it becomes NaN downstream.
- This indicates an integration/bounds robustness issue, not a spectral-math issue.

## What works (hard evidence)

- Forward/inverse FFT normalization and pipeline wiring:
  - Inverse normalization is applied as 1/N³ when writing real output.
  - Code: [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/k-fft.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/k-fft.js) sets `u_normalizeInverse = 1/(N³)` for the final inverse stage.
  - Shader: [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/fft.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/fft.frag.js) (collapsed='to') multiplies the real part by `u_normalizeInverse` before writing to R32F.
- Poisson formulation is standard and guarded:
  - φ(k) = -4πG ρ(k) / k², with safe handling at k=0; supports discrete vs continuous k².
  - Code: [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js).
- Gradient formulation is correct:
  - F(k) = -i k φ(k), per-axis.
  - Code: [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/gradient.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/gradient.frag.js).
- Force sampling matches the grid (no extra scaling):
  - Trilinear interpolation from real-space force grids; uses world bounds mapping.
  - Code: [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/force-sample.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/force-sample.frag.js).
- Mass deposition behaves and conserves total mass (in 32³ evidence):
  - Additive blending to R32F; NGP/CIC paths, world→grid mapping in the vertex shader.
  - Code: [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/k-deposit.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/k-deposit.js), [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/pm-deposit.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/pm-deposit.frag.js).

These working pieces align with the consistent force magnitudes seen across inverse-FFT force grids and the sampled forces, i.e., sampling doesn’t radically rescale – it preserves the grid’s small amplitudes.

## Likely root causes of the magnitude discrepancy

- Missing conversion from mass to physical density before Poisson
  - The PM mass grid stores mass per voxel (unit: mass), but Poisson expects density ρ(x) (unit: mass/volume).
  - The physical density should be ρ = mass / ΔV, with ΔV = (Lx/N)·(Ly/N)·(Lz/N) = (Lx·Ly·Lz)/N³.
  - If the pipeline feeds “mass” instead of “density” into the FFT/Poisson, φ and hence F will be scaled down by ΔV.
  - For worldSize L = 6 in each axis and N = 32: ΔV = (6/32)³ = 0.1875³ ≈ 6.59e-3. Missing 1/ΔV ≈ 151.9× would make forces ~152× smaller than analytic — in the right ballpark for the observed 50–150× shortfall.
  - Code inspection:
    - Deposit: [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/k-deposit.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/k-deposit.js)/[`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/pm-deposit.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/pm-deposit.frag.js) writes mass, not density.
    - Poisson: [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js) treats the input as ρ(k) and does not divide by voxel volume.
- Assignment window deconvolution might be off by a constant factor
  - [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js) applies a product of sinc windows raised to `u_deconvolveOrder` for NGP/CIC/TSC.
  - The exact 1D window for CIC in Fourier space is W1D(k) ≈ sinc(kΔx/2)²; implementation uses `sinc(π·kg/N)` raised to order – this could differ by constant factors depending on convention (grid vs physical wave numbers).
  - A constant gain error here would also uniformly scale force magnitudes.
- Potential double-counting or omission of physical scaling in k-space
  - [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js) computes k² using physical k_phys = 2π·kg/L; gradient uses the same physical k scaling.
  - If the input spectrum isn’t in physical units (i.e., mass vs density), the combined unit scaling will produce mismatched magnitudes consistently across setups.

Secondary suspects and non-factors:
- Softening: Not applied in the spectral pipeline here; unlikely to explain large uniform scaling.
- Sampling attenuation: Trilinear interpolation at particle positions is consistent with grid magnitudes; it doesn’t add a >10× scale change.
- FFT normalization: Verified as correct (forward unnormalized, inverse 1/N³) and consistent with observed spectrum→grid magnitudes.

## Recommended verification steps for the specialist team

- Normalize mass grid to physical density before FFT/Poisson:
  - Option A: Divide the real-space mass grid by voxel volume ΔV prior to forward FFT.
  - Option B: Multiply the spectrum by 1/ΔV inside [`../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js`](../particle-system/gravity-spectral-kernels/shaders/poisson.frag.js) before applying the Green’s function.
  - Verify that this change lifts 32³ two-body sampled |F| toward ≈ 7.5e-5.
- Cross-check assignment deconvolution constants:
  - Re-derive CIC/TSC window factors in terms of the shader’s kg/N convention; adjust power/arguments if needed to match standard PM references.
- Keep 64³ NaN debugging separate:
  - Those NaNs appear before spectral stages (positions NaN in KDeposit). They’re likely due to integration/bounds or NaN-guarding issues, not spectral magnitude math.

## Conclusion

- The spectral math (FFT normalization, Poisson, gradient) and sampling/deposit plumbing function as designed, but the magnitude of forces is consistently too small in 32³ runs.
- The most probable cause is an omitted mass→density normalization by voxel volume, potentially compounded by a constant-factor mismatch in assignment window deconvolution. Adjusting for ΔV should move forces toward analytic expectations.

## Proposed change: KFFT uniform-based normalization (forward-only)

Introduce a small, reversible change in the KFFT pipeline to convert mass-per-voxel to physical density via a uniform scale, applied only on the forward path that ingests the mass grid. This keeps the mass grid semantics intact for other consumers while giving the spectral pipeline the density that Poisson expects.

Rationale
- Mass deposit currently accumulates mass per voxel (units: mass).
- Poisson expects physical density ρ (mass/volume); required conversion factor is 1/ΔV, where ΔV = (Lx·Ly·Lz)/N³.
- Applying the factor only on the forward (mass→spectrum) path avoids touching deposit, sampling, or inverse FFT code, and does not require any “de-multiply” on the way back.

Changes (concise)
1) Shader generator (KFFT “collapsed” variants)
  - Add a new uniform in the generator for collapsed forward passes that read the mass grid, e.g. `uniform float u_massToDensity;`.
  - Gate the use of this uniform behind a conditional that only applies when the source texture is the mass grid and the phase is forward/collapsed-from (do not apply in inverse/collapsed-to): multiply the sampled scalar by `u_massToDensity` before packing to complex.
  - Do not apply any de-scaling in the collapsed-to (inverse) variant. The 1/ΔV conversion is a physical unit change, not an FFT normalization to be undone.

2) KFFT class (JS)
  - Add an argument/property (e.g., `massToDensity = 1.0`) to the KFFT constructor/options so the particle system can update it at runtime when worldSize/gridSize change.
  - During forward runs that read from the mass grid, bind the uniform to a value. The value should be calculated by the external code (particle system) this way: `massToDensity = 1.0 / ΔV`, where `ΔV = (Lx * Ly * Lz) / (N * N * N)` and `Lx,Ly,Lz` come from world bounds.
  - For all other forward passes (non-mass inputs) and all inverse passes, omit the uniform entirely in the shader and do not bind inside KFFT run method.

Contract (quick)
- Input: mass grid (mass-per-voxel).
- Output (to Poisson): spectrum corresponding to density ρ(x) = mass(x)/ΔV.
- No change to inverse path: inverse FFT and force-grid writes remain as-is (still using existing 1/N³ inverse normalization).

Defaults and updates
- Do not default `massToDensity`, it must be provided.
- If world bounds ever adjusted, set `massToDensity = N³ / (Lx·Ly·Lz)` immediately, or make a recalculation on every frame before scheduling KFFT run.

Validation
- Two-body 32³ case: expect sampled |F| to increase by ≈ N³/(L³) (e.g., ≈151.9× for L=6, N=32), moving toward the analytic 7.5e-5 baseline.
- If a small residual scale remains, verify assignment-window deconvolution constants next (CIC/TSC) and confirm discrete-vs-continuous k² mode selections.
